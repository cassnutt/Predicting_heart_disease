    "---\n",
    "Different features were examined to determine if any had an individual correlation to cardiovascular disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a feature was created to look at body mass index. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using height and weight, I was able to create a BMI column and see that individuals diagnosed with cardiovascular disease do have higher BMI's than those that do not have cardiovascular disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "![BMI_boxplot](images/BMI_boxplot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Next, I looked at blood pressure. Blood pressure is the pressure of circulating blood against the walls of blood vessels. Most of this pressure results from the heart pumping blood through the circulatory system. The American Heart Association categorizes blood pressures by the systolic and diastolic measurements that are taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "![AHA hypertension](images/BP_chart.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the systolic and diastolic data to create the same categories, it appeared that patients with blood pressures in the \"High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) Stage 2\" category were most as risk of being diagnosed with CVD. Individuals with extremely high blood pressure (categorized as \"Hypertensive Crisis\" were also severely at risk of having CVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "![BP_chart](images/BPs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "After that, I looked at age. I grouped ages into decades to see if there was a pattern. Younger individuals (in 30's and 40's) had a decreased risk of being diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. However, once in the 50's and 60's, one was more likely to be diagnosed with CVD and being in your 60's doubles the risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also looked at ages and weight. The 30's had the smallest range of weights. The other ages were fairly similar, though it was clear that as one aged, being lighter in weight did not prevent them from being diagnosed with CVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Age_vs_weight](images/age_weight.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Not only did this study have a balanced amount of people with and without the disease, gender had fairly equal amounts of those with and without CVD. However, it is important to note that the proportion of men and women was not balanced, having almost two-thirds of the data being women, and a little over one-third of the data as men. This data shows that one gender is not more at risk than the other.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this data cholesterol was ranked as 1: Normal, 2: Above normal, or 3: Well above normal A quick check found that individuals with above normal or well above normal levels of cholesterol were at an increased risk of having CVD. In face, 76% of those that had well above normal cholesterol as had cardiovascular disease.\n",

    "* Glucose\n",
    "    * Those with glucose levels \"Above normal\" or \"Well above normal\" were diagnosed with CVD more often\n",

    "When looking at the subjective features, activity was the most important feature followed by smoking then drinking alcohol.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features indicated that when faced with a patient who has a high systolic reading, very elevated cholesterol levels, and is older, it would be prudent to run further tests and check for cardiovascular diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be important to coach these patients about a need to increase activity, improve diet, and decrease or stop smoking and drinking alcohol. A follow up should be done to check blood pressure and cholesterol levels again and consider prescribing a statin drug that would decrease cholesterol levels."
